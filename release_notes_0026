Release Notes 0.026

There's a new page in Preferences, "Other". Currently, this only contains settings for sexual preferences. They're all on by default, but you might wanna take a look and see if anything there bothers you, and in that case, turn them off.
This is a WIP, so currently not all of the items on there is even in the game (planning for the future), and all content might not have been updated for it either. So, currently, it's more of a gimmick, than actual settings that affect the game. But, in the future, these settings WILL affect which scenes you see, extra scenes, and so on. I don't think I'll include anything that REQUIRES specific content to be enabled, but there might be some achievements and such you can't get unless you have everything enabled.
