Walkthrough HSS 0.26


DAY 1:
Start game, type in your preferred name, if you don't want to use "Marten"

Choose to view intro, or skip it (viewing intro gives you two images in the gallery on your phone)

After intro, in garage, you can choose to try and work on the bike, but you'll be too distracted to get anything done

You should go talk to Jules, as if you don't, you'll get minus relationship points at the start of every day until you talk to her

When talking to Jules, this is the correct sequence for most points during the suntan scene:

Shoulders
Legs
Feet
Butt
Back
Butt

Turn over

Shoulders
Legs
Feet
Stomach
Breasts

If you follow this procedure, you'll have enough points to get her to take her top off

And your relationship with Jules will increase by 11 points

After this, you don't really have anything you HAVE to do, you can explore a bit, and if you happen upon Anne in the kitchen you'll get a scene for that as well (need to go to the kitchen at 16.30 - non-repeatable)

You should go back to your room, and pick up the phone, the wallet and the backpack (you can also pick up the books on the shelf, but they're not needed yet)

You can also go by the bathroom, and see if there are something there you might want to pick up

If you click on the red car in the garage, you'll get a hint (look at the phone, it turns red, and if you open up the phone, you'll see that there is a red ring around the hint-icon, top right) about needing the carkeys to drive the car - these you'll have to find

To find the keys, go back into the livingroom, and into the kitchen (or upstairs) - then go back to the  livingroom - you'll see the keys are on the livingroom table

When all of this is done, you can either go back to the garage and work on the bike a little bit, take the car out for a spin (to earn money working as a TripIt Black driver) or just go to bed

(Keep an eye on the phone - if it turns red, you have a new hint which might get you out of problems you have)


DAY 2:
